Dynamic programming
===================

Dynamic programming is used to solve optimization problems such as to find the
maximum / minimum off all feasible solutions satisfying a set of conditions.

This is different from the greedy method which is also used to solve
optimization problems as it tries to solve by exploring all possible solutions
instead of using a pre-defined method as used in greedy method.
